Well my good old LGA775 - 2008 pc is dying because bad electricity system in my anthillish hive.
It happens twice at this week.
The shitty electricity system is making overall pulsation in room sockets and destroying electronics for years (almost 19 years).
PSU is helping a bit. But my UPS is a long dead thing and they're to expansive for using with 850 or 1KW PSUs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Motherboards have a lot of components but only 3 of them are them most vulnerable:

1. Network controllers.
Internal Network controllers are true zombies.
They're becoming unresponsible from time to time and triggering The BLUE Screen.
But in my situation a half-dead network chip is impossible to initialize without using its internal ROM.
So to use my network controller I have to reorganize my BIOS boot list and place the network ROM firmware on top.
Does it help a lot ? Not too much.
If I'm using it for a long time by watching streams or youtube videos my performance is dropping to its minimum.
That's the perfect example of a chip degragation.
You may think it's about oveheating. But no. Passive cooling system is attached to it.

How to fix: Use an external pci-e network controller if possible and delete all drivers for the bad one.


2. South Bridge and SATA Controller.
Bad news - you don't know what is really degrade first.
You think - fuck my hdd/ssd or a disk drive (yeah I'm still using the BLUE RAY one) is dying but no.
It's a half true - your hdd/disk drive might be damaged too but only 
because of bad internal power system of SB and SATA controller.

The symptoms are:
- Long and unresponsive BIOS loading;
- Unable to identify all attached SATA and USB devices;
[Including their names and serial numbers in the boot menu];
- The operating system is stuck on its loading/boot screen without blue screens;
- You have very unresponsive windows explorer;
- It also degrades performance.

How to fix: Buy SATAtoUSB adapaters and attach your old and slow or new hdd to USB ports.
It should help to decrease these hardware fails to minimum.

3. Audio controllers.

The symptoms are:
Almost the same as for network controllers but you don't have a sound device.

How to fix: By using an external usb or pci-e device.


RAM problems:
All RAM problems because of - low power (time to replace your PSU), bad overclocking or bad sticks.

How to fix: If you have read/write errors when you just start the software you're always using -
it's time to replase one of the stick. But first - test it. One by one. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you can see -> Motherboards are Frankensteins and still working even with bad components attached.

If you have your old PC - test it for hardware fails periodically.

If you really want to test your HDD/SSD for bad sectors you should have a SataToUSB adapter and
a working PC (low TDP laptops are very good as testing machines at this point).

Now my last words here:
Well after the incident with my father (I hate him) I broke up with my higher education in 2012.
Then russian army. But in 2013 I've tried to go back to my technical university.
In shirt - FUCK you - they said. The academic difference between my previous specialty and
the current one I want to study is completely different. But that is not true.
I broke up at the 4th year. Physics, maths and computer science and graphics. 
All things are same. I knew it. 
You know what's the problem, right ? 
Corruption. 
No budget place for me and at the same time the cost of education was extremely high (x2,5 than average salary even before fucking Crimea and coronavirus shit).
So I was completely kicked off.
All of the top fuckin university stuff want some money from you. 
Including professors, lecturers and other sorts of shit. 
They're manipulating you cuz if you're kicked off - welcode to Russian army - the worst and useless time in your life.
You can't complete your education without wasting your money.
Education system in Russia is completely rotten. 
It's a slicy better in other regions in Russia. But overall is full of shit.

I'm unemployed and in fuckin Russia especially in Moscow I can't find a job from 2017.
Employing system in Russia is almost the same as the education one but with some interesting things to know:

- The most valuable vacancies are always hidden, average too. Why ? The answer is next.
- If you don't have money to buy a better place to work - fuck off (Yeah. In Russia corruption is everywhere).
- If you're not a student - fuck off  [Discrimination by age]
- If you're not a well-educated student - fuck off [Discrimination by grades]
- If your education is irrelevant/not from the place they want you to be graduated [Discrimination by university]
If your education is irrelevant/not from the place they want you to be graduated
- If you're nothing and they are literally don't know you.
- There's no way to get a change for a job in top companies. Why ? Cronyism.
We know him/her no matter how good they're as employees. But you're not a son of "Mister P" or "Missis J" so fuck off.
- Dirty salaries. Over 80% of companies are manipulating with taxes. Clean salaries are very rare.
[ For example: If your "salary" is 40000 russian roubles you will get only 18000-20000 
and another part is envelope salaries and it's not for you if the company structure is based on Cronyism or they don't like you.]
- Lying at employment to suck you in their corruption cronyism system
[You're going to do all the job for the sons and daughters or if you're not a passive slave - they will kick you off].
[As a bonus - your career in other companies will be in danger. The scums will try to make everything to achieve your unemployment for a long time].

I was a freelancer before and doing a sysadmin/virus cleaning/hacking and reverse engineering stuff for money 
but I just tired of this shit and you know working as a freelancer is very risky and the amount of degenerates around you is growing. 
The most stupid one tried to hack me by sending viruses "for research". 
So I've got my negative reputation on some hacking forums for refusing to work with such degenerates.
No prepayment. I can't guarantee that I'm capable to do something. So the money question always was the last thing for me.

I'm doing everything with passion cuz I like it. That what hobby is. But people are love to fuck your brain even if they got something for free.
Yeah. I'm not tolerant to stupid, lazy people and timewasters.
I'm always trying to fix the problem and always continue when I think that I can improve something more.
No need to push me. Things changed and I didn't accept requests. I don't want to get money from idiots and waste my time for nothing.

I'm refusing to take money from my parents. 
I've never ever asking to help me on such problem cuz I understand the price of money and how hard to get it.

Only gifts from them are acceptible.
So I'm in the situation when I can lost almost 14 years of my programming stuff and various researching dox, notes etc.
I don't even remember how much times I did a backup from one HDD to another.

So. My projects are not finished. My ideas are still in my heads. And nothing can stop me. They will be finished anyway.

Yeah. I know. My english is bad. But I'm living in Russia and I don't care. And only true idiots are blaming other people for using non-native languages improperly.
